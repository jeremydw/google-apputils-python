run internal Python apps at Google.

Features:

  * Simple application startup integrated with python-gflags.
  * Subcommands for command-line applications.
  * Option to drop into pdb on uncaught exceptions.
  * Helper functions for dealing with files.
  * High-level profiling tools.
  * Timezeone-aware wrappers for datetime.datetime classes.
  * Improved TestCase with the same methods as unittest2, plus helpful flags for
    test startup.
